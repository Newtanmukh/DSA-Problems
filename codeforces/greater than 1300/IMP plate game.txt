if atleast one circleis fit inside the plate,it
means that the total number of circles that will be fitted is odd
as wewill place once circlein center and rest all will be placed symmetrically
which will be even



If first player can't make first move 
(table is too small and plate doesn't fit it, i.e. 2r > min(a, b)), second player wins.
s Else first player wins. 
Winning strategy for first player: place first plate to the center of table. 
After that he symmetrically reflects moves of second player with respect to center of table.
 If second player has move, first player has symmetrical move, too.
 If not, first player won
