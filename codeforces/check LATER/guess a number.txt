the thing is that,if it is greater than or equal to and no, treat  it as less than. and for yes, if  >= x, then it is >x.

similary do for reverse as well.

now convert greater than to greater than or equal to. similary convert everything to either greater than or equal to or
smaller than or equal to. then, for greater than or equal to, find the maximum among those.
similarly for smaller than or equal to , find the minimum. if max<min, then its impossible.
