create arr[M] and a[K].

find the number of common elements between these two arrays.
 that will be the number of source file both tracked and ignored.

after that create array int array[N]

then,

(for i=0;i<m;i++)
{array[arr[i]]++;}

(for i=0;i<k;i++)
{array[arr[i]]++;}

count = 0;
(for i=0;i<N;i++)
{
if(array[i]==0)
{count++;}
}


cout<<(no of common elements)<<count<<endl;
