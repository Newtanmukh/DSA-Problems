develop  a recurrence relation for the same.

T(n+1) = T(n) + (n/2) + 1 if n is even
T(n) + (n-1)/2 + 2 if n is odd

i did this by taking into consideration a string of length n. then i added a blank to the start one. 
so now the string is of length (n+1). so now, if the first letter added is H , then the number of cases will be T(n)
if the letter added is K, then the number of cases will vary according to length.
