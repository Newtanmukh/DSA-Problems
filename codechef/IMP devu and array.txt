just sort this array. if you think logically,you will come to know that infact the
 whole array can be transformed into any of the 
elements between
the maximum and the minimum element.

example- 1,3,5,7,9 becomes 1,1,5,7,9 or 2,2,5,7,9 or 3,3,5,7,9 or 3,3,3,7,9. so if min<=t<=max,then it is possible.
