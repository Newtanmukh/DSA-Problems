if n>k*l then ofcourse this information is wrong and will return -1
//if k==1 and n>1 also this will return -1 since we cant have the order as 11111...n times as no two players can repeat.
however if its k=2 then we can arrange it as 121212......
//in the following code we try to arrange the overs as - suppose number of overs is 8 and number of players is 5 and l=3.
in that case         we will write it as       12345123
